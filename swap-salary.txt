Swap Salary

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' 
and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement 
for this problem.

The query result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Salary table:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+

Output: 
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Explanation: 
(1, A) and (3, C) were changed from 'm' to 'f'.
(2, B) and (4, D) were changed from 'f' to 'm'.

UPDATE salary
SET sex = CASE WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
               WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
          END;
